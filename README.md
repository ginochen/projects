# Projects:

- Coding sample for the Transformer model using just NumPy:
  - `transformer_project.py`: contains the main transformer model and helper functions
    - Helper functions demonstrating the use of different algorithms and data structures (e.g., quickselect, Trie, max heap/priority queue) for some simple NLP metrics. 
  - `NN.py`: contains a fully connected neural network using NumPy modified from https://github.com/SkalskiP/ILearnDeepLearning.py.

- Warning: NOT production code! This project is done under extreme time constraint (2 days) so some parts are pseudo-code or left as placeholders.
