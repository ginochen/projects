# Projects:

- Sample code for the Transformer model using just NumPy:
  - `transformer_project.py` classes: 
    - `Transfomer()`: The main Transformer model  
    - `helper()`: The use of different algorithms and data structures (e.g., quickselect, Trie, max heap/priority queue) for some simple NLP metrics. 
  - `NN.py`: A fully connected neural network using NumPy modified from https://github.com/SkalskiP/ILearnDeepLearning.py.

WARNING: NOT production code! This project is done under extreme time constraint (2 days) so some parts are pseudo-code or left as placeholders.
           This is solely used for demonstration of ML knowledge and algorithms.
