# Projects:

- Sample code for the Transformer model using just NumPy:
  - `transformer_project.py` classes: 
    - `Transfomer()`: The main Transformer model  
    - `helper()`: The use of different algorithms and data structures (e.g., quickselect, Trie, max heap/priority queue) for some simple NLP metrics. 
  - `NN.py`: A fully connected neural network using NumPy modified from https://github.com/SkalskiP/ILearnDeepLearning.py.

- Sample code for Hadoop MapReduce using Java:
  - Create a `WordCount.java` file to count the frequency of words in a file usingn MapReduce.
  - Use bufferedWriter to write the contents of split words into a file.
